## Make Works, hello! :wrench::earth_americas: :computer: 
Open-access database of local manufacturing, so that both creatives and consumers can take an active role in where and how ‘things’ can be made or repaired.

* e/g mapping the places and people you need to make or repair : makerspaces, tool libraries, workshops, factories, manufacturers, tradespeople, machine shops, material suppliers
* e/g helping designers to design for distributed manufacturing
* e/g supporting the fabrication of components for repair
* e/g sourcing electronics for IOT products (privacy, security)
* e/g finding new processes to be used for making artworks or design objects (experimentation, craft, art fabrication)
* e/g commissioning local businesses to make small scale runs of products

We're hoping that by opening up our API and asking people to contribute, others might create more experiments e.g http://extension.make.works/
